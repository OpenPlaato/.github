## OpenPlaato

In the wake of plaato.io's [announcement to discontinue homebrewing devices](https://plaato.io/pages/homebrewing),
we are a community of volunteers who are investigating how to continue using our
[Keg](https://plaato.io/products/plaato-keg) and [Airlock](https://plaato.io/products/plaato-airlock) devices
through local polling.


### Current Status

We are currently investigating the underlying hardware components of both the Keg and Airlock products. Initial
investigations suggest both devices may be amenable to running custom, open-source firmware.

### Community

Discussions about both the hardware and firmware for both Airlock and Keg can be found on
